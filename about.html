<h2><strong>Photon</strong> born from scientific high performance</h2>

<p>
<strong>Photon</strong> started in 2010 with the redesign of the <a href="http://www.chemeo.com">Cheméo chemical properties search engine</a>. This search engine is not only a standard search engine but also a calculation engine. To run properly, Cheméo uses:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MongoDB</strong> as a backend.</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> to parse and import data.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> to perform statistical analysis and model development (linear and non linear models).</li>
<li><strong>PHP</strong> as a glue language to serve the web interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Researchers using Cheméo are pushing and retrieving job all day long,
at the end, the traditionnal push a job, put in the queue, get a
service pulling out of the queue the job, send it to R and push back
the results in the database and finally get the information to the end
user that the job completed approach was a bit of a hack.
</p>
<p>
Enters <strong>ZeroMQ</strong>, one can easily dispatch jobs in
queues, subcribe to the answers, nice but nothing new. Ok brokerless,
this makes it easier. Enters <strong>Mongrel2</strong>, bring the
power of the easy message passing paradigm of ZeroMQ from the client
all the way to the backend. An homogeneous stack. This was clear,
after a decade of web application development that it was the way to
go.
</p>

<p>
For the story, the name <strong>Photon</strong> was found
by <a href="http://pioupioum.fr/">Mehdi Kabab</a>. Most of the code is
lifted from the previous <a href="http://pluf.org">Pluf framework</a>
which was already one of the fastest.
</p>
