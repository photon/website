<h1>Photon Performance Against PHP as Module</h1>

<p>Photon is as fast as the baseline PHP of a traditional PHP as a
module setup.  This means that you can have both ease of development
with a high quality framework and high performance.</p>

<h2>Photon Is The Fastest</h2>

<p>Because nothing is faster than a photon. <strong>Photon reaches 90% of the baseline PHP</strong> where the fastest other frameworks are always below 1/3 of the baseline.</p>

<p>For the "Hello World" application, <strong>Photon</strong> is about:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.7 times faster than Symfony 2.0.0alpha1</li>
<li>3.2 times faster Solar 1.0.0beta3</li>
<li>4 times faster than Lithium 0.6</li>
<li>4.7 times faster than Yii 1.1.1</li>
<li>5.2 times faster than symfony 1.4.2</li>
<li>10 times faster than Zend 1.10</li>
<li>18 times faster than CakePHP 1.2.6</li>
<li>180 times faster than Flow3 1.0.0alpha7</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Framework            |      rel | Photon is about:
-------------------- | -------- | -----------------------------------------
photon-dev           |   0.9041 | ########################################
symfony-2.0.0alpha1  |   0.3312 | ##############
solar-1.0.0beta3     |   0.2825 | ############
lithium-0.6          |   0.2128 | #########
yii-1.1.1            |   0.1901 | ########
symfony-1.4.2        |   0.1737 | ########
zend-1.10            |   0.0906 | ####
cakephp-1.2.6        |   0.0513 | ##
flow3-1.0.0alpha7    |   0.0048 | |
</code></pre>

<p>Ranking based on the relative values against the baseline-php
generated by the <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/fast">Symfony benchmarks</a> (this page has been taken offline, you have <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/1222">another copy of the figures available</a>).</p>

<h2>All The Benchmarks Are Lies</h2>

<p>First, you need to know that all the benchmarks are made to look nice against the other frameworks and at the moment you will not find a single benchmark summary where each framework author say: "<em>Yes this is the optimal you can get out of my framework</em>". For example, you have the <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/fast">Symfony benchmarks</a> which were not updated <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/1222">when Paul M. Jones</a> showed that had some flaws. Worse, they do not include <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> or <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/">Kohana</a> because these two are known to be really fast. At the end you have a so called <em>"Product" Application</em> benchmark, for a real life application, just discard it, as it is <em>not auto escaping the output of the variables</em> for Symfony (but for all the other frameworks always doing so automatically) and the auto escaping in the template engines is the limiting factor as they are all compiled as pure PHP.</p>

<h2>Only The Hello World Is Worth Something</h2>

<p>Yes, only the traditional <em>Hello World!</em> benchmark is interesting because it measures the overhead of the framework. It answers the question: <em>The day I really need to squeeze out the maximum performance of my system, what is the limit?</em>. You cannot go faster than that per page, after, you need to scale up or out.</p>

<h2>Now The Results</h2>

<p>All the tests have been run on a very small setup running Ubuntu Lucid
Lynx with the stock Apache and mod_php without particular tuning. The
software used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Siege 2.68</li>
<li>Apache 2.2.14</li>
<li>PHP 5.3.2</li>
<li>Mongrel2 1.5</li>
<li>ZeroMQ 2.0.10</li>
</ul>

<p>The content of the baseline PHP is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo 'Hello World!'; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The content of the baseline HTML:</p>

<pre><code>Hello World!
</code></pre>

<p>The content of the Photon view:</p>

<pre><code>class Hello
{
    public function hello($request, $match)
    {
        return new \photon\http\Response('Hello World!', 'text/plain');
    }
}    
</code></pre>

<p>The baseline HTML returns about 2900 transactions per second.</p>

<pre><code>$ siege -b -c4 -t5S http://localhost/hello.html
** SIEGE 2.68
** Preparing 4 concurrent users for battle.

<p>The baseline PHP returns a bit less than the HTML version. It
correctly reflects the normal difference between the baseline PHP and
baseline HTML you can find all over the web for such minimal test
case.</p>

<pre><code>$ siege -b -c4 -t5S http://localhost/hello.php

<p>The baseline Photon returns about 2500 transactions per second. 
<strong>More than 90% of the PHP baseline!</strong></p>

<p>I have been running several time the 5 second tests, longer, siege is
exhausting the available sockets and cannot connect anymore. This is
because I am running these tests on a small old simple system. Note
the differences in the throughput, this is because Apache is sending
way more headers (put still everything in one TCP packet).</p>

<p>Maybe you wonder how many requests can the <strong>Photon</strong> server itself
handle by connecting directly to it via the ZeroMQ handlers, simple,
<strong>3943 transactions per second</strong> with a stupid test script, I am sure
it can be more, but I do not really care anyway. Of course in that
case, you do not have the HTTP overhead anymore, this is why you
cannot compare, but what is great, is that <strong>Photon</strong> is not the
bottleneck and all the improvements made to Mongrel2 will immediately
be translated into better performances.</p>

<p>If you wonder how can <strong>Photon</strong> support a high level of concurrency,
do not worry about it, from 4 to 100 concurrent connections, it stays
between 2250 and 2500 req/s.</p>

<p>So, now, you can stop reading stupid benchmarks like this one, just
code and have fun!</p>

<h2>Is 4000 Transactions per Second Slow?</h2>

<p>All the test were run directly on a low power, 4 year old, dual core
CPU. The important point here is that <strong>Photon</strong> itself will never be
your bottleneck. The day you will start to pump 4000 req/s to your
clients, you will anyway not send just a <em>Hello World!</em> string. Your
business logic will automatically be in the order of 20 to 50 ms and
this will be your bottleneck. Anyway, people getting <a href="http://pinboard.in/blog/173/">50 requests per second in real life are very happy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is important is that in normal conditions, on a correct hardware, you will never need to put a cache layer in front of a resource served by Photon. The only bottleneck will be your data store if you query it for some fancy stuff.</strong></p>

<p>What you will do is simply take benefit of the zero configuration
scaling power of Photon and spread the load over several backend
servers. This means that you will be able to scale out
transparently. The only overhead will be the network latency and the
cost of having more workers on the round robin scheduler of ZeroMQ, in
practice these should be negligeable.</p>

<h2>Number of Handlers Effect</h2>

<p>Note that these tests were directly run against the current in
production website. This is why the transaction numbers are a bit
different, a bit higher, but the purpose here is not to have big
numbers but the difference between these numbers.</p>

<p>With the commands <code>hnu server new</code> and <code>hnu server less</code> you
start/stop new children to handle the load. By default, you get 3
children. On a small dual core system (<a href="http://www.openvz.org">OpenVZ VM</a>), this
means that you have 4 processes handling the requests: 1 Mongrel2 and
3 Photon children. It looks like that for the very small <em>Hello
World!</em> test (a closure directly in the <a href="urls.html" title="Definition of the URLs in Photon">URL map</a>), this is
the sweet spot. After that, you are at the limits of your system and
you end up being CPU bounded.</p>

<p>Then run was simply <code>siege -cXX -t15S http://www.photon-project.com/hello</code> 
with a first 2 second run just after adding a new child to the pool and XX with either 10 or 25.</p>

<p>In this case, 4 processes is a sweet spot to extract the maximum out
of the two cores. After that, you lose a bit because of the context
switching between processes on a maxed out system. If you have more
cores available I expect the number of transactions to increase the
same way to a higher limit and then, again, plateau. The good points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>with one installation, you can fine tune the number of children to take maximum benefit of all the cores available;</li>
<li>it looks like the sweet spot is not affected by the number of concurrent connections;</li>
<li>if you over commit resources you pay little price for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For reference, the <a href="http://www.photon-project.com/hello" title="Hello World!">Hello World!</a> view definition is a very
simple closure:</p>

<pre><code>array('regex' =&gt; '#^/hello$#',
      'view' =&gt; function ($req, $match) {
          return new \photon\http\Response('Hello World!', 'text/plain');
      },
      'name' =&gt; 'photonweb_hello',
     ),
</code></pre>

<p>The tests were performed between two OpenVZ VMs over a LAN. The real
interesting next step would be to add new VMs, each runnig a Photon
instance and all responding to the main Mongrel2 servers. But I am a
bit lazy to test this right now.</p>
