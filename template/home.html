<h2><strong>Photon</strong> is a high performance micro PHP framework.</h2>



<dl>
<dt><strong>High performance</strong><dt>
<dd><strong>Photon</strong> is run behind <a href="http://www.mongrel2.org">Mongrel2</a> and is <a href="{url 'photonweb_autodoc', 'performance'}">3 to 10 times faster</a> than Zend, Symfony and the best standard mod_php frameworks.</dd>
<dt><strong>Micro</strong><dt>
<dd><strong>Photon</strong> does not try to do everything, the core is small, easy to understand and without magic.</dd>
<dt><strong>Tested</strong><dt>
<dd><strong>Photon</strong> is delivered with a 100% test coverage.</dd>
{*<dt><strong>Future proof</strong><dt>
<dd>Using <strong><a href="http://www.mongrel2.org">Mongrel2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a></strong> you can easily integrate your business logic with your <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> code.</dd>*}
<dt><strong>Asynchronous</strong><dt>
<dd>Easily manage <a href="{url 'photonweb_autodoc', 'tasks'}">background tasks</a> to send emails, index your content, perform long running jobs.</dd>
<dt><strong>Message Passing</strong><dt>
<dd>Built on top of <a href="http://www.zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>, you can integrate your <strong>Photon</strong> project with your business logic (Python, C/C++, Fortran with C, R with Python) easily.</dd>

<p>
<strong>Photon</strong> is a technology preview. It is not yet recommended to use it in production.
</p>

<h2>Why is Photon Different?</h2>

<p>
At the core <strong>Photon</strong> is a PHP application server. That
is, your code is loaded once at the start and then never again until
the next restart. This makes <strong>Photon</strong> fast without the
need of APC.
</p>

<p>
An application server communicating over <strong>ZeroMQ</strong> means:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You can open long running connections to your backend.</li>
<li>You can easily start new workers on different hosts than <strong>Mongrel2</strong>.</li>
<li>You can run background operations just after sending the response to the client (index the content, send emails).</li>
<li>You can efficiently stream data to your clients (realtime chat, stats, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Why a micro framework?</h3>

<p>
You start a framework, then you add components, then you add magic to
hide the complexity of all the components you added, then you add
helpers to work nicely with the magic. At the end, your PHP framework
archive is bigger than the code of your webserver and most of the
projects need to use 5% of it. So, a micro framework is a framework
doing perfectly these 5%.
</p>
<p>
Soon, you will be able to downloads high quality components for your
web application through the <strong>Particles Project</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Why targeting Mongrel2?</h3>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.mongrel2.org">Mongrel2</a></strong> is a
very well designed, high performance server developed by pragmatic
users who do not like bloated software. The use
of <strong>ZeroMQ</strong> as the communication hub makes it extremely
flexible while keeping the incredible performance. As a result, one
can easily write part of a project with <strong>Photon</strong> and
use other languages for some special parts. Oh, and the community
behind <strong>Mongrel2</strong> is really nice.
</p>

<h3>What is the interest of ZeroMQ?</h3>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a></strong> is a high
performance messaging layer on top of TCP, IPC or PGM multicast. With ZeroMQ,
you can easily get a worker to connect to the Mongrel2 server over
your LAN, this makes extremely easy to distribute your workers on
several systems with zero configuration. For example, you can migrate
your workers from one host to another without downtime.
</p>

<pre>
# Start Photon on server 1, all the load is handled by server1
you@server1:~/myproject$ hnu server start
# Start Photon on server 2
you@server2:~/myproject$ hnu server start
# Now the requests are spread over server1 and server 2
# Stop Photon on the first server
you@server1:~/myproject$ hnu server stop
# All the load is handled by server 2 without any downtime
# and no reconfiguration of Mongrel2.
</pre>

<p>
Of course you can distribute the load over your workers with more than
just a round robin pattern.
</p>

<h3>Why not just a Mongrel2 adapter for an existing framework?</h3>

<p>
To really take benefit of <strong>Mongrel2</strong> one needs to have
an asynchronous framework. With <strong>Mongrel2</strong> you do not
have the traditional one request get one answer approach. This means
that the standard PHP SAPI, which needs for each request an answer, is
not adapted. As all the current frameworks are using the one request,
one answer approach, you cannot take full benefits
of <strong>Mongrel2</strong> with them. For example, you cannot easily
create an MP3 streamer or a realtime chat application.
</p>

<h3>What is the release number convention?</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>0.0.XX</code>: will be the first alpha releases.</li>
<li><code>0.1.0</code>: will be the first beta release, you can expect a couple of beta releases to get the core components up and running.</li>
<li><code>1.0.0</code>: will be the first stable release.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once the stable release will be reached, the formalism will be: <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>.
